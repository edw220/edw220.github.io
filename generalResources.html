                <h2>Livesplit</h2>
                <p>Livesplit is timing software for tracking the length of your run. There are a bunch 
                    of useful ways to take advantage of livesplit, including individual stage or even 
                    room timers. Additionally, some communities have developed automatic splitting plugins
                    for specific games, but this is limited to games played on PC only. Livesplit is 
                    available for <a href="https://livesplit.org/downloads/">download here</a>.</p>

                <h2>Open Broadcast Software (OBS)</h2>
                <p>Open Broadcast Software, commonly referred to as OBS, is video capture software often 
                    utilized to record speedruns. You can use it to capture gameplay, livesplit, and even 
                    inputs. Recording your own gameplay is essential for leaderboard submission, but also 
                    has the benefit of being able to review your gameplay for improvement. You can
