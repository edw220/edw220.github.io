                <h2>What Is Speedrunning?</h2>
                <p>Speedrunning is a way to play video games where the “runner” attempts to go 
                    as quickly as they can to a target point while staying within community determined 
                    rules.</p>
                <hr>
                <h2>Why Do People Speedrun?</h2>
                <p>Speedrunning has many functions. It entertains the 
                    runners as well as viewers. It also has a deeper meaning of self-improvement. 
                    The idea of overcoming adversity to achieve self-set goals. It helps to empower 
                    individuals in a greater sense as well as providing a friendly community amongst 
                    runners. Check out my page of <a href="generalResources.html">general resources</a> 
                    for more info on how to start! </p>

                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I've been a speedrunner for 6 years with a focus primarily on platformers. I've held a 
                    couple of world records in the past. I also have a passion for teaching people and sharing
                    my knowledge as well as learning. On that note, don't be shy to reach out if you think 
                    you've got a great strategy! One of the biggest misconceptions about speedrunners is 
                    they have nothing to learn from casual players. Often we get new strategies from those 
                    who have a fresh look at the game and how to play it.</p>
                <p>This is a short list of games that I have run. Not all of these have been
