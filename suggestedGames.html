                <p>Below I have selected a handful of games I believe to be varying levels of 
                    challenge to learn. I've ordered them from easiest to most difficult, and 
                    included examples of my runs so you may get an idea of how challenging the 
                    runs are or what you might expect. </p>

                <h2 id="Astalon">Astalon: Tears of the Earth</h2>
                <p>Astalon is a 2D action platformer focused on swapping between characters to solve 
                    puzzles or defeat enemies. It is a metroidvania, and while it has a few quirks 
                    in how it plays, I found the overall experience to be enjoyable. There are a couple 
                    categories on the <a href="https://www.speedrun.com/astalon_tears_of_the_earth">speedrun page</a> 
                    including Any%, 100%, or even separate modes like 
                    <a href="https://www.speedrun.com/astalon_tears_of_the_earth?h=The_Black_Knight-Any&x=wk60g9ok-wl39466l.5q8wkkyq">Black Knight</a>. 
                    Below you'll find a recording of my latest run of Black Knight mode. I've chosen 
                    this as the most approachable run due to it's length of about 15-20 minutes, and 
                    the general simplicity of movement. This game can be played on Nintendo Switch, 
                    PC, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and a first playthrough will take you somewhere 
                    between 15-20 hours to beat.

                <h2 id="TheMessenger">The Messenger</h2>
                <p>The Messenger is a 2D action platformer with strong level design that lends itself 
                    well to speedrunning. There are a number of pathways through most screens with varying 
                    skill required to execute. The story has a few twists, so I won't say too much about it, 
                    but if you enjoyed retro classics like Ninja Gaiden this is a must play. The primary 
                    category for The Messenger is called "<a href="https://www.speedrun.com/the_messenger">8-Bit No Out of Bounds</a>"
                    which runs approximately 30-60 minutes depending on skill level. Below you'll find a 
                    recording of my latest run of 8-Bit No OOB. This speedrun has the benefit of being 
                    approachable while also having a lot of room for optimization. This is an excellent 
                    starting point for those who are already familiar with platforming basics and 
                    really want to break into speedrunning in general. This game can be played on Nintendo Switch, 
                    PC, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and a first playthrough will take you somewhere 
                    between 12-25 hours to beat.

                <h2 id="MetroidDread">Metroid: Dread</h2>
                <p>Metroid: Dread is a 3D action platformer that takes place on a 2D plane. The fact that 
                    this game is at its core a 3D game lends itself to some of the more complex tricks that
                    it offers. Metroid: Dread has a high barrier for entry for skill, and is not for those who 
                    are easily dissuaded by difficulty. Because of all of that, mastery of Dread ends up feeling 
                    intensely satisfying. 
                    <a href="https://www.speedrun.com/mdread?h=Any-No_Major_Glitches-Rookie&x=9kv83mjd-wle962k8.013jgmdl-ylp6w5rn.jq66533q">Any% No Major Glitches (NMG)</a> 
                    is the category I'd recommend to those just starting out with this game. Below you'll find 
                    my latest recorded run of Metroid: Dread Any% NMG. This game is only available on Nintendo 
                    Switch. If you are interested in speedrunning it, I would recommend purchasing a digital 
                    version and storing it on the storage local to the Switch. The reason is because utilizing 
                    both the digital version and local storage will save you literal minutes over the course 
                    of an Any% run. A first playthrough of Metroid: Dread will take you somewhere between 
                    20-40 hours to beat.
